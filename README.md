Shed a different light to a picture.

## Description
Vision is a simple algorithm that generates and outputs a new, different style of image based on the given input image.

An example output is shown above.

## Website
The official website and web implementation can be found and used at [projects.xtrp.io/vision/](https://projects.xtrp.io/vision/).

## Code
Vision is written in both Python (3) and Java. Both programs should be run from the command line, in the following formats, respectively:

```
$ curl https://projects.xtrp.io/source/vision/vision.py -o vision.py
$ python3 vision.py path/to/input_image.png path/to/output_image.png
```

```
$ curl https://projects.xtrp.io/source/vision/Vision.java & javac Vision.java
$ java Vision path/to/input_image.png path/to/output_image.png
```

Note that the input and output images can be of any mainstream image filetype (png, jpeg, etc.).

Also note that before running either the Java or Python versions, Java/Python3 must be installed on your machine.
